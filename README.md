### Product Details:


* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 1259682749
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-1259682742
  * * Author:  James Bidlack
   
  * This introductory text assumes little prior scientific knowledge on the part of the student. It includes sufficient information for some shorter introductory botany courses open to both majors and nonmajors, and is arranged so that certain sections can be omitted without disrupting the overall continuity of the course. Stern emphasizes current interests while presenting basic botanical principles. This latest edition incorporates measurable learning outcomes and updated readings. Students will be introduced to the new classification of plants and plant-related species, integration of biotechnology into several chapters and inclusion of new text boxes addressing the areas of ecology, evolution and molecular biology. New photos have replaced older pictures or have been added also.

 23) Plant morphology is a discipline that deals with the naming and classification of plants.




 24) Van Helmont concluded after his classical experiment with the willow tree that its increase in weight had been due to the water it had absorbed.
